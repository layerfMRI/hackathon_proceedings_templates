@article{Stirnberg2021a,
abstract = {Purpose A segmented k-space blipped-CAIPI (skipped-CAIPI) sampling strategy for echo planar imaging (EPI) is proposed, which allows for a flexible choice of EPI factor and phase encode bandwidth independent of the controlled aliasing (CAIPIRINHA) pattern.Theory and Methods With previously proposed approaches, exactly two EPI trajectories were possible given a specific CAIPIRINHA pattern: either with slice gradient blips (blipped-CAIPI), or following a shot-selective approach (higher resolution). Recently, interleaved multi-shot segmentation along shot-selective CAIPI trajectories has been applied for high-resolution anatomical imaging. For more flexibility and a broader range of applications, we propose segmentation along any blipped-CAIPI trajectory. Thus, all EPI factors and phase encode bandwidths available with traditional segmented EPI can be combined with controlled aliasing.Results Temporal signal-to-noise ratios of moderate-to-high-resolution time series acquisitions at varying undersampling factors demonstrate beneficial sampling alternatives to blipped-CAIPI or shot-selective CAIPI. Rapid high-resolution scans furthermore demonstrate SNR-efficient and motion-robust structural imaging with almost arbitrary EPI factor and minimal noise penalty.Conclusions Skipped-CAIPI sampling increases protocol flexibility for high spatiotemporal resolution EPI. In terms of signal-to-noise ratio and efficiency, high-resolution functional or structural scans benefit vastly from a free choice of the CAIPIRINHA pattern. Even at moderate resolutions, the independence of sampling pattern, echo time and image matrix size is valuable for optimized functional protocol design. Although demonstrated with 3D-EPI, skipped-CAIPI is also applicable with simultaneous multislice EPI.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Huber2021a,
abstract = {Recent methodological advances in fMRI contrast and readout strategies have allowed researchers to approach the mesoscopic spatial regime of cortical layers. This has revolutionized the ability to map cortical information processing within and across brain systems. However, until recently, most layer-fMRI studies have been confined to primary cortices using basic block-design tasks and macro-vascular-contaminated sequence contrasts. To become an established method for user-friendly applicability in neuroscience practice, layer-fMRI acquisition and analysis methods need to be extended to more flexible connectivity-based experiment designs; they must be able to capture subtle changes in brain networks of higher-order cognitive areas, and they should not be spatially biased with unwanted vein signals. In this article, we review the most pressing challenges of layer-dependent fMRI for large-scale neuroscientific applicability and describe recently developed acquisition methodologies that can resolve them. In doing so, we review technical tradeoffs and capabilities of modern MR-sequence approaches to achieve measurements that are free of locally unspecific vein signal, with whole-brain coverage, sub-second sampling, high resolutions, and with a combination of those capabilities. The presented approaches provide whole-brain layer-dependent connectivity data that open a new window to investigate brain network connections. We exemplify this by reviewing a number of candidate tools for connectivity analyses that will allow future studies to address new questions in network neuroscience. The considered network analysis tools include: hierarchy mapping, directional connectomics, source-specific connectivity mapping, and network sub–compartmentalization. We conclude: Whole-brain layer-fMRI without large-vessel contamination is applicable for human neuroscience and opens the door to investigate biological mechanisms behind any number of psychological and psychiatric phenomena, such as selective attention, hallucinations and delusions, and even conscious perception.},
